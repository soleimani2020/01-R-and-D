## üß© Repository Categories

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Core1: SMARTINI3** | Minimal yet realistic ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) membrane model. Parameterized systematically using **unsupervised learning** and **multi-objective evolutionary algorithms**. Maintains biophysical fidelity while enabling large-scale simulations, achieving ~35% faster performance with Martini membrane proteins compared to standard models. |
| **Core2: Data_Analysis** | General-purpose Python scripts for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations. Focuses on membrane systems, proteins, water, and other biomolecular components. |
