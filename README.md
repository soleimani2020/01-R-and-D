## üß© Project Categories

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **SMARTINI3 Membrane Model** | Minimal yet realistic ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) membrane model. Parameterized systematically using **unsupervised learning** and **multi-objective evolutionary algorithms**. Maintains biophysical fidelity while enabling large-scale simulations, achieving ~35% faster performance with Martini membrane proteins compared to standard models. |
| **MDAnalysis & Python Scripts** | General-purpose Python scripts for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations. Focuses on membrane systems, proteins, water, and other biomolecular components. Designed for tasks like calculating mean-square displacement, radius of gyration, local curvature, and other structural properties. |
