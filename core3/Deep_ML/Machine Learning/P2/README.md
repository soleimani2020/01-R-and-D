# Transpose of a Matrix

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Category:** Linear Algebra  

## Description

Write a Python function that computes the **transpose** of a given 2D matrix. 

The **transpose** of a matrix is obtained by turning its **rows into columns** and **columns into rows**. For an `m×n` matrix, the transpose will be an `n×m` matrix.

### Example

```python
Input:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
]

Output:
[
    [1, 4],
    [2, 5],
    [3, 6]
]
