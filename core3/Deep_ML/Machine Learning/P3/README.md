# Dot Product Calculator

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Linear Algebra

## Description

Write a Python function to calculate the dot product of two vectors.  
The function should take two 1D NumPy arrays as input and return the dot product as a single number.

## Example

```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
print(dot_product(a, b))  # Output: 32
